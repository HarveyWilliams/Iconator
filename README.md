Iconator
==
_Property editor for Umbraco 7._

Iconator is a custom data type that allows an editor to select a class for a custom icon from a CSS file, but in a visual way. The class name is saved into the property value which can then be used in your view. This is useful because font files can be used for icons rather than selecting an image.

This is a fork of https://github.com/rhythmagency/rhythm.umbraco7.font-awesome-icon-picker except it allows you to use any icons from a custom CSS file. The UI has also been updated to seamlessly integrate with Umbraco 7.
